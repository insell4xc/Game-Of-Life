# Game of Life

This is the cellular automaton "Conway's Game of Life".

Cells you set at the beginning will die or stay alive with following rules:


Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


The cells you set at the beginning change their state after one cycle. One cycle will last 0.1 seconds.

The whole life cycle changes depending on the selection of cells at the starting point.



Hit SPACE after selecting the starting cells to start the life cycle.
